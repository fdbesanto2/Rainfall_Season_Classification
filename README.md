# Rainfall_Season_Classification
Rainfall anomaly classification with climate teleconnections ENSO and IOD
Seasonal to annual forecasts of precipitation patterns are very important for water resources management. Success in making useful forecasts often is achieved by considering climate teleconnections such as the El-Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) as related to sea surface temperature variations. Quadratic discrimination analysis (QDA) and classification tree models are used to identify the patterns of rainfall classes with respect to ENSO and IOD indices. Ensemble modeling tool Random Forest is also used to predict the rainfall classes as drought and not drought with higher skill. These models can be used to forecast the areal rainfall using predicted climate indices. Correlation analysis, normality testing of data is also carried out. Codes are written R programming language
